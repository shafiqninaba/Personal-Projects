# Text Classification

This is a natural language processing project in Python that uses different pipelines (Naive Bayes, LinearSVC, NLTK VADER) from a dataset of 2000 movie reviews, to determine whether a review is positive or negative.

## Getting Started
This project was coded in Jupyer Notebook, hence having the .csv dataset in the same location as the notebook should work.

### Prerequisites
Libraries required:
1. NumPy
2. scikit-learn
3. NLTK
4. Pandas

*side note: VADER lexicon needs to be downloaded first if you haven't done so. Run this in a Jupyter Notebook cell*
```
import nltk
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
```
