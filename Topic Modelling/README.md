# Topic Modelling

This is a natural language processing project that trains a machine learning model from a dataset of 400,000 Quora questions, to map them to a specific topic.

## Getting Started
This project was coded in Jupyer Notebook, hence having the .csv dataset in the same location as the notebook should work.

### Prerequisites
Libraries required:
1. scikit-learn
2. Pandas
