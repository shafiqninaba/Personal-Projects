# Text Generation

This is a natural language processing project that uses a trained machine learning model to generate the next 50 words after being given a text of length 25 words from the story of Moby Dick by Herman Melville.

## Getting Started
The project was coded in Jupyter Notebook, hence having the dataset and the .h5 model file in the same location as the notebook should work.

### Prerequisites
Libraries required:
1. spaCy
2. TensorFlow
3. Keras
4. NumPy
5. Link to "epochBIG.h5" (model used):
