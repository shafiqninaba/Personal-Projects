# Q&A Bot

This is a natural language processing project in Python that uses Keras to make a bot, with a model trained with a dataset of stories, that answers "yes" or "no" based on a given story. For example, 
```
Story:  John left the kitchen . Sandra dropped the football in the garden .
Question:  Is the football in the garden ?
Predicted answer is:  yes
```
## Getting Started
This project was coded in Jupyer Notebook, hence having the "chatbot_120_epochs_v2.h5", "train_qa.txt" & "test_qa.txt" files in the same location as the notebook should work.

### Prerequisites
Libraries required:
1. NumPy
2. scikit-learn
3. Keras
4. TensorFlow
5. Matplotlib
